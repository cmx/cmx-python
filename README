Introducing CMX
===============

   REPL with Python Scripts via live documents.

See CMX In Action
-----------------

- ☐ insert a screencast gif here

this works just like a standard jupyter notebook. Only code-block you include
in a ``with doc:`` block would be shown. The row context arranges the
result side ways (via html) but it shows as a list on GitHub due to css
restrictions.

.. code-block:: python

   for i in range(10):
       doc.print(i, end=' ')

::

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

Installation
------------

You can install this package from PyPI under the ``cmx`` package name.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install cmx

Developing Plugins
------------------

You can develop plug-ins under the ``cmx-<>`` prefix

Discussion
----------

Can we have a ``travel-back-in-time`` debugger that saves the stack at
each frame?
